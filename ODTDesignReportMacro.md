# XDocReport OOo Macro #

With XDocReport, the odt reporting is done with Open/Libre Office by inserting input field to mark the field name to replace with a value. For the report designer user it's very difficult
to know which names fields it must use in the odt report. Types the input field name at hand can give some bugs because the field name is not well formmatted (don't follow the template engine syntax, is not well spelled).
